// comeback, trainer routing) bypass this and call Walker.WalkTo directly — they
// take the free-preferring route with no prompt, using only the teleports the
// user allowed automatic walks (Settings → Teleports).
//
// The flow: resolve the current room, then plan (PlanRouteChoice) — the forks in
// priority order are walk-vs-teleport, trap-avoid, avoid-override, then the
// free-vs-direct item-gate fork; failing all, a fully-blocked "run to the block"
// offer or a plain walk. A sole route whose gates are all auto-obtainable arms
// acquisition and walks with no prompt. Anything else surfaces the picker, whose
// answer commits the chosen route; cancel walks nothing.
//
// Planning runs off the UI thread when the walker is idle (so a big-graph plan
// doesn't freeze the app), and a slow plan surfaces a "Calculating…" window while
// it runs; see WalkAsync.
