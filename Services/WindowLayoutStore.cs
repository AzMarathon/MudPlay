// Per-character window position + size memory. Each top-level window calls
// AttachWindow once during construction with a stable id ("main", "backscroll",
// etc.); the store wires Opened / Closing / Closed so the window restores its
// prior bounds on Opened, captures the current ones on Closing, and drops out of
// the open-set on Closed.
//
// The dictionary is hydrated from CharacterProfile.WindowBounds on
// ProfileService.ProfileLoaded and snapshotted back on
// ProfileService.ProfileSaving. A window that the user has never moved / resized
// has no entry, so opening it uses whatever position + size the XAML declared.
//
// Loading a profile also re-applies its layout to windows already open — their
// Opened handler ran against the previous profile, and Opened won't fire again
// on an open window, so a profile switch has to move them explicitly.
//
// Restore is screen-aware: a saved position still visible on a connected monitor
// is honoured as-is (a window intentionally parked on a second screen reopens
// there), but one whose monitor was unplugged — or that now falls off every
// screen and can't be grabbed — is re-anchored next to the main UI and clamped
// fully on-screen, so the app never opens split across a monitor that's gone.
//
// Tiny windows (under 80×60) and zero-sized windows are rejected on capture —
// those are usually transient measurements during the teardown sequence, not
// the user's "where I last left it" state.
