namespace MudPlay.Services.Update;

// Generates the tiny external helper that performs the actual install swap AFTER
// this process exits — the running executable and its loaded libraries can't be
// overwritten in place, so the app stages the new build, spawns one of these, and
// quits; the helper waits for the PID to die, replaces the install (keeping a
// backup for rollback), relaunches, and cleans up. On success it removes the staged
// download, the rollback backup, AND itself — no update leftovers survive in temp.
//
// Pure string generation so the scripts can be unit-tested without running them.
// Every path is passed as a positional argument (never interpolated into the body)
// so a path with spaces can't break the script.
