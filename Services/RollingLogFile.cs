// A line-capped append log persisted to a single file. Retains only the last
// MaxLines lines on disk — the tail rolls forward as new lines arrive, so a
// long-lived log can't grow without bound. Content survives process restarts:
// Open reloads the existing tail and appends continue from there.
//
// Thread-safe behind a single lock. Append does only the in-memory bookkeeping
// (add + trim) on the caller's thread, then hands the actual file write to a
// coalesced BACKGROUND flush — the whole file is still rewritten so the on-disk
// count can't overshoot the cap, but that rewrite no longer runs on the caller's
// thread. The chat / transaction pump runs on the UI thread, and a full rewrite
// per line stalled the Conversation window under heavy chat; off-loading it keeps
// the window smooth. A single-flight writer serializes writes and always persists
// the LATEST tail, so a burst of appends collapses to one rewrite and no two
// writes race. Rare operations that must be immediately visible (Close, Truncate,
// SetMaxLines) write synchronously via Flush. I/O failures (a locked file, a
// permission flap) are swallowed — a log that can't be written must never take
// down the feature it's recording.
