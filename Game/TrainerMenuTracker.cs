// Detects the brief excursion into the in-game trainer stats menu so
// downstream subscribers can react when the user returns to the realm —
// specifically, AutoPartyManager uses MenuExited to refresh any party members
// whose [Invited] slot is still open on our leader-side state but whose own
// party view was dissolved by the brief absence.
//
// State machine, leader-side only:
//   1. User sends train stats (or just train) on the wire — ObserveOutbound
//      arms ExpectingMenuWindow seconds of "expecting menu" time.
//   2. Within that window, the anchored MenuTrainerStatsMarker line ("Point
//      Cost Chart") is observed — confirms we're in the menu, snapshots the
//      current non-self roster, and flips _inMenu = true.
//   3. While in the menu, the in-game prompt (StatusLine) doesn't fire because
//      the trainer screen is a full-screen ANSI menu.
//   4. When the user exits the menu, the next in-game prompt fires; that's our
//      exit signal — fire MenuExited and reset.
//
// The outbound-command gate guarantees no chat / gossip line containing "Point
// Cost Chart" can ever flip the state machine on its own — without an outbound
// train stats the marker is ignored entirely.
//
// Initial character creation is the one entry path with no outbound train
// stats: the game menu walks class → race → alignment → training on its own.
// That training screen still renders the same full-screen menu, and its top
// row carries the "MAJOR MUD Character Creation" box beside the "Point Cost
// Chart" panel. A marker line bearing BOTH phrases stands in for the outbound
// gate — a chat line can't carry both — so the state machine flips and
// downstream input switches to character mode just as it does for in-game
// training.
