// The @dupe <player> command (SysopCommands, i.e. Elevated Commands). Lets a trusted
// player bring an alt up to speed with one telepath: it copies the sender's QUERY and
// @roomba permissions onto the named player. It rewrites who is trusted, which is why
// only Elevated senders may use it, and why it is fenced in three ways.
//
//   - Narrow. Only the categories in Shareable move. Nothing that acts on the
//     character (move, @do, settings, invites, hangup, divert) and never Elevated
//     Commands, so a duplicated player can't dupe onward and anything beyond queries
//     stays a manual step in the Players tab.
//   - Once. A sender may @dupe a single time. The spent use is stored on their player
//     record and stays spent until the user resets it in the edit dialog, so it can't
//     be re-armed remotely. The use is spent only by a grant that actually happened:
//     a refusal or a no-op leaves it available.
//   - Logged. Every use and every refusal is written to the program log, and the
//     record keeps who was duplicated onto and when.
//
// The copy is additive: the target keeps what it holds and only gains, so @dupe can
// never take a permission away. Only the permission grid moves; the target's party
// toggles and notes stay.
//
// Two more refusals protect the user. The local character is refused because the
// Players tab hides its row and permissions granted to yourself mean nothing. A name
// the client has never seen is refused because a typo would otherwise pre-grant trust
// to whoever later takes that name.
//
// The telepath / gangpath restriction is enforced by the engine through
// RemoteCommandCatalog.IsPathChannelOnly, before this handler runs.
