// Paces a multi-line data reply (an @roomba sync, a @loop send) out one line at a
// time so a big payload (a gang-house log runs dozens of lines) can't monopolize the
// outbound channel and starve the engine's real-time commands (combat, heal,
// movement) — it's triggered by another player's request, so it must stay in the
// background. Even serialized
// (TelnetClient no longer interleaves writes), a tight burst still floods; this
// trickles them ~800ms apart, leaving a wide gap for other sends between each.
//
// Rate-limit aware: if the game reports a hard clobber ("You are typing too
// quickly - command ignored" on stock; "Too many messages sent …" on paradigm),
// the caller pokes NoteClobber — we then pause a few seconds and re-send the last
// line (the receivers tolerate a duplicate: a roomba merge is newest-wins, a loop
// chunk just overwrites its own slot), so nothing is lost even if the pace briefly
// clips the limit.
