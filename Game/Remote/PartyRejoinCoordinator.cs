// Follower-side reconnect auto-rejoin. When we drop out of a party (a crash, a
// carrier loss, or any disconnect) and later re-enter the game, this telepaths
// @comeback to the leader we were following so they walk back and re-collect us.
// Once @comeback is on the wire the leader owns the whole recovery — they decide
// whether to come (distance / party-full gates), walk to us, and re-invite. A
// follower runs no movement of their own, so beyond the short room wait below
// there is nothing here to wait on: fire @comeback and we're done.
//
// Crash-vs-clean-close memory. The leader we follow is remembered in a
// crash-survivable slot (AppServices write-throughs _rememberedLeader into the
// loaded profile via PersistLeader + Save on every change). A hard crash leaves
// that slot populated, so the next launch hydrates it and rejoins; a clean
// shutdown clears it (see MainWindow's Closing handler), so a deliberate quit
// forgets. A deliberate in-game leave (leader dissolves / uninvites / we
// unfollow) clears the slot the same way — only an unexpected drop leaves it
// set. The slot always mirrors live follower membership, so a crash at any
// moment retains the right leader. Because the slot is empty on a fresh session
// with no prior party, a first-time connect never fires @comeback — rejoin is
// reconnect-only by construction.
//
// One-shot per connect. Arm() (called on every client.Connected, alongside
// StatlineReconcile.Arm) opens a latch that fires on the first in-game prompt —
// the statline the server prints once we're back in the realm. The prompt is
// used deliberately over the room display: a dark room prints no exits, so a
// room-display latch would survive until a light later reveals a room and then
// misfire @comeback long after the reconnect (at a leader we may already have
// rejoined). The statline lands even in the dark, bounding the fire to the
// reconnect window. If no leader is remembered the fire is a no-op, so a fresh
// session with no prior party stays quiet.
//
// The @comeback carries our room ("@comeback M/R") so the leader walks straight to
// us — but only a room confirmed since this connect. The tracker can still hold the
// room we dropped from (the server may put us back somewhere else), and a Paradigm
// `rm` resync lands a moment after the first prompt. So the prompt starts a short
// wait for a fresh confirmation, and only if none comes in RoomWait does the bare
// @comeback (leader backtracks) go out.
//
// Remembered-leader auto-join override. IsRememberedLeader is handed to
// AutoPartyManager as a force-accept predicate: when the leader we're
// remembering re-invites us, we auto-follow even if their per-player "join if
// invited" flag is off. Remembering that we were in their party is itself the
// standing consent to rejoin them.
//
// Read-only on party state: it observes PartyState (never writes it) and only
// emits an outbound telepath, so it composes with every other party subsystem.
