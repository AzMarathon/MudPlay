// On-demand party-inventory probe. Asks the whole party "do you have this item,
// and how many?" by broadcasting @have <item> to every non-self member and
// aggregating their replies into a single PartyItemResult. Backs the party stage
// of the path-item pipeline: when a walk-route crosses an
// (Item: N) / (Ticket: N) gate whose per-member item we lack, PartyPathItemGate
// probes the party first and — if a member has a spare — has them hand it over
// instead of posting a search / shop need.
//
// The round-trip rides the existing remote-command plumbing: the query goes out
// through PartyBroadcaster.Broadcast (one /<given> @have <item> per member), and
// each member's InventoryQueryHandler.OnHave replies "yes - Nx '<q>'" /
// "no - nothing matching '<q>'" back over an incoming telepath. We subscribe to
// ChatRouter.EntryClassified and correlate each reply by the echoed '<q>' item
// name, so several per-item queries can be in flight at once
// without their replies crossing wires.
//
// A query completes early once every expected responder has replied, or when the
// QueryWindow elapses. A member who never answers (offline, no QueryInventory
// grant for us, hasn't parsed inventory) adds nothing to the total and is named in
// the result's Unanswered: still a member, taken to hold none.
// The expected-responder set mirrors PartyBroadcaster's own filter (non-self,
// named, joined), so we never wait on a member the broadcast skipped. With no one to ask
// the task completes synchronously with an empty result, letting the caller fall
// straight through to its fallback.
