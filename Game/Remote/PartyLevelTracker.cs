// Serves the party level-gate for path planning. Bounds() gives the party's
// most-constraining (Low, High) level window that MovementFilter reads at BFS
// time to route a following party around a (Level: MIN to MAX) gate the group
// can't clear — rather than stranding a member. WarmStaleLevels() fires a
// demand-driven @level re-probe when a planned route actually crosses a level
// gate and a member's recorded level is unknown or not from the current day.
//
// Keeping levels warm in the ordinary case — the once-a-day @level/@version
// refresh on partying with someone — lives in PartyProbeManager now; this type
// only READS the PlayerDatabase cache (Bounds) and tops it up on demand for a
// level-gated route (WarmStaleLevels). Both are leader-scoped: routing a
// following party around a gate is only meaningful while we lead.
//
// A member not yet probed contributes their title-derived band (see
// PartyLevelEstimate) so planning degrades gracefully until a reply lands
// instead of blocking on a round-trip. A recorded exact level counts as fresh
// for the current local day — the same "once per day" cadence the probe uses —
// so a route re-probe only fires when the reading is missing or from a prior
// day. Any @level reply (the auto-probe OR a manual /<player> @level) refreshes
// the cache through PartyLevelProbe, so a manual ask counts as today's reading.
//
// Invited members are never counted: an invited-not-joined row exists only for
// the PartyWindow chip and isn't yet someone we route the party around.
//
// Read-only on party state: never writes a party field.
