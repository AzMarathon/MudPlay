// Leader-side follower recovery. Three entry paths converge on the same walk-to-
// re-collect flow:
//   - Path A (@comeback): a stranded follower telepaths @comeback <map>/<room>
//     (e.g. @comeback 9/1012) or a bare @comeback. Used when the follower still
//     remembers us across the drop (a crash) and drives the pickup themselves.
//   - Path B (@where probe): the leader stayed in game and remembers the party.
//     When a dropped member re-enters the realm inside the grace window
//     (PartyManager raises MemberReturned), the leader telepaths @where, parses
//     the location reply, and recovers them — the fallback for a follower who
//     cleanly closed and lost their @comeback memory.
//   - Path C (left behind): a follower who couldn't move with us (held, knocked
//     down) falls off the party (PartyManager raises MemberLeftBehind); we
//     backtrack to where we left them.
//
// All paths run the same gates before committing: skip if our party is already
// full (we backfilled the slot while they were gone) and skip if they're farther
// than the return-distance setting, declining via @forget + a spoken reason so
// the member isn't left waiting. Otherwise we pause the running movement engine,
// walk to recover them, re-invite (left-behind members are dropped from the party
// server-side), wait for the follow confirmation, then resume. The member
// following us again ends the recovery at whatever stage it has reached.
//
// Stop-and-restart, not gate-pause. Asserting a MovementCoordinator gate would
// block the recovery walk itself — AutoWalkManager.WalkTo parks in Paused while
// any gate is asserted. So we snapshot the running engine's resume state, Stop()
// it, run the recovery walk gate-clean, then re-Start the captured engine.
//   - Idle (no engine running) → reply "I can't I'm idle" and do nothing.
//   - Explicit room → walk straight there, re-invite, await follow, resume.
//   - No room → walk backwards along the path just taken (the
//     RoomTracker.GetHistory trail), room by room, up to ReturnDistanceRooms,
//     checking for the follower at each arrival; recover on sight, else go idle
//     and let the player handle it.
//
// @forget is the counterpart teardown, bidirectional: a follower telepaths it to
// call off their own pickup, or the leader telepaths it to decline recovery. Both
// sides drop the other from the roster + grace window and clear any crash-rejoin
// memory, so neither keeps chasing the other.
//
// Everything runs on the UI thread — AutoWalkManager.Event,
// PartyManager.MemberFollowConfirmed, PartyManager.MemberReturned, the router
// telepath fan-out, and the follow timeout's DispatcherTimer all fire there, so
// no marshalling is needed. Single-flight: one member is fetched at a time, and
// the others left behind with them wait their turn (QueueRecovery).
//
// Two cases where nobody is gone back for at once, both the user's rulings of
// 2026-10-10:
//   - A train trip: a party train trip, or the leader's own train run with the
//     party in tow. Neither the game's drop line nor a member's @comeback stops
//     its walk; each member it leaves is kept with the room they were left in and
//     fetched when the training is done (TrainTripEnded), from however far. A
//     trip taken out of its own hands (the user's Stop, a run started over it)
//     fetches nobody: the pickup is the player's then.
//   - A loop whose own circuit goes through an exit that turned the member away.
//     Their @comeback is refused and the loop carries on; the rule, and how the
//     leader tells an exit's doing from a hold, is above LeftAtAGateOnOurLoop.

    // engine then does is the user's ruling for each (2026-10-10):
    //   - A loop would leave them at the same exit every lap: it carries on and
    //     refuses their @comeback ("it should reject them").
    //   - A walk-to, or an errand's walk, goes back and re-invites once ("on a walk
    //     to, it absolutely should comeback for them"). Turned away at the same exit
    //     again once the walk is under way again, the walk ends there with a notice
    //     naming them and the exit, and no second pickup is started ("option A").
    //     Another gated exit further on gets its own one pickup.
    //   - Auto-Lair doesn't break off. It carries on and invites them when a pass
    //     next finds them in a room it enters ("auto-lair will just pick them up
    //     again on its next pass in the room").
    //
    // When the exit is what turned this member away:
    //   - For a loop, only an exit its own circuit takes, crossed by a step of the
    //     loop. A gate on the walk to the circuit, on a train trip's walk or crossed
    //     by hand is not the loop's, and the member is gone back for.
    //   - Not when they told us they are held or waiting (SignalledHold): that is
    //     what stopped them, and they are gone back for.
    //   - Not, for a loop or Auto-Lair, when the exit is known to admit them
    //     (MemberCanPass true: level, class, race, purse and item all known and
    //     met). Where the leader can't tell, the gated step counts as the cause.
    //   - What the game does beats what we hold of them: fetched from an exit once

    //     judge says, until the run is over or they are seen through it.
