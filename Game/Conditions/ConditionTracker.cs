//
// User-extensible by design: the user defines what lines map to what condition
// effects via the Game Data Browser → Messages tab. No hardcoded ailment names
// live in the text matching — flags come from the records or an authoritative
// server status. A realm with a unique status effect "Cursed" needs a Messages-tab
// entry, not engine code.
//
// Matching is case-sensitive substring containment — verbatim text from the
// record. An empty AppliedMessage skips the record entirely; an empty
// AppliedEndsWith means "no auto-clear" (caller must explicitly clear via
// ClearAll on disconnect / death).
//
// Index rebuild fires on every MessageStore.Messages collection change so the
// user's live edits in the Messages tab take effect immediately without a
// session restart.
