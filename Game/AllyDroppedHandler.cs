// Party reaction to an ALLY dropping to the ground (hitting 0 HP — mortally
// wounded, bleeding out, not yet dead). Distinct from PlayerDroppedGate, which
// owns OUR OWN drop; this owns everyone else's. Not scoped to a healer: `aid` is
// universal and by itself lifts a dropped ally back above 0 HP, so any party
// member reacts — a heal top-up (when configured) merely speeds the recovery.
//
// The whole flow is confirmed MajorMUD mechanics (see GAME_MECHANICS.md, the
// "Drop removes you from your party" section):
//   • "<name> drops to the ground!" is the room/party-side signal a member went
//     down. The dropper sees it with their own name, so a self-match is ignored.
//   • A dropped ally leaves `par` — their vitals stop refreshing — so once we've
//     brought them back we poll their HP out-of-band via an `@health` telepath.
//   • `aid <name>` (universal) stops the bleeding; it doesn't stand them up. HP
//     then climbs 1 per 30 s tick until it's positive, and until then they can't
//     act or answer a telepath. A heal cast AT THEM BY NAME still lands even though
//     they're off the roster and gets them up sooner (fed to CastingDirector via
//     AidedDownedGivenNames).
//   • So the rescue is timed off the climb: a `@health` reply at negative HP gives
//     the exact wait, else the realm's death floor gives the longest it can take
//     (the deepest living HP is floor + 1). We check on them once that's up.
//   • Recovery to positive HP does NOT auto-rejoin the party — an explicit
//     `invite <name>` is required, and they can't accept it until they're up. Only
//     the leader can send it, so the re-invite waits for a positive `@health` and
//     is gated on SelfIsLeader (a follower's leader re-invites THEM instead).
//   • The drop is treated as a wait condition: AllyDownGate holds every movement
//     engine so we stay in the room and keep aiding / healing rather than walking
//     the farm loop off without the downed member.
//
// Recognition gap this handler closes: in the reported failure the ally that
// dropped was the LEADER, and a leader-disconnect dissolves the party — so by the
// time "MudPlay drops to the ground!" arrived, MudPlay was already off our roster AND
// absent from PartyManager's disconnect grace map (a follower never stamps its own
// leader there). We therefore keep our OWN recent-leader memory: when LeaderName
// clears we snapshot the departing leader's given name with a timestamp, and a
// drop line for that name within RecentLeaderGrace is recognised as an ally.
//
// Threading: MessageRouter + ChatRouter already marshal to the UI thread and the
// DispatcherTimer ticks on it, so all state here is touched single-threaded.
