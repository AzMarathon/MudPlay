// Drives MajorMUD's `train stats` screen to apply the character's saved CP plan.
// A pass is started three ways: TrainNow (TrainerWalkManager, standing at the
// trainer after its own fresh `stat`), ApplyTargets (the CP Allocation tab's
// "Apply this level") and the user's own `train stats` with Auto-train stats on.
// It waits for the screen to come up, types the stats with a short delay between
// strokes, and the form's SAVE-default Exit commits on the final Enter.
//
// Menu-open detection is realm-independent. Stock realms scroll the trainer's
// "Point Cost Chart" marker as an inline line, so TrainerMenuTracker.MenuEntered
// fires and drives the replay immediately. Paradigm draws the stat box with
// cursor positioning — the marker row never completes until teardown, so
// MenuEntered never fires mid-session. For that path we fall back to the
// command-driven signal TrainerMenuTracker already arms for the terminal's
// character-mode switch: after a short render delay, if the input menu is still
// active (full-screen menu owns the keyboard, no in-game prompt returned) we
// begin the replay; if instead the in-game prompt came back (InputMenuExited —
// we weren't at a trainer) we abort cleanly. MenuExited is likewise marker-driven
// and never fires on Paradigm, so InputMenuExited is also our exit signal.
//
// What gets typed is decided with the form on screen. The form shows the trained
// stats and the CP left, with no spell in them, so when it can be read the plan
// is worked from it; the `stat` screen's figures are the fallback, and only when
// that reading can be trusted. Targets are clamped to the CP on hand via
// CpPlanCalculator.ClampRowToBudget and typed as absolute values. Before SAVE the
// form must show exactly what was meant, or the pass stops and leaves the form to
// the user: CP can't be unspent. A row is reported applied only after the form
// has closed, from what it showed (or, for a form that couldn't be read, from the
// CP on a follow-up `stat`). Sessions are id-tagged so a late timeout from a
// finished run can't disturb a newer one. The manager never touches Family Name /
// appearance fields.
