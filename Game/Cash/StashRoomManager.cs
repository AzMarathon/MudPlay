// Stash dispatch for user-marked stash rooms. Offloads every coin denomination
// at or below CashSettings.StashCoinCutoff (or all of them when it's Everything)
// into one `hide N <coin>` command per denomination (lowest denomination first,
// so the coins left on hand are the fewest possible), then one `hide <item>` per
// carried item flagged ItemOverlay.AutoStash. The keep-on-hand floor is a banking
// rule (see CashSettings) — a stash keeps only the higher, filtered-out coins.
//
// Two triggers. A stash fires either as a step of an auto-deposit reroute (when
// the wealth / coin gate trips while a Loop or Auto-Lair is running and the
// configured destination is a stash room, AutoDepositManager walks the character
// there and calls ExecuteStash on arrival) OR when the character naturally passes
// through a stash room that sits on the active loop / lair route — a dedicated
// detour is only spent on a stash room that is off-route. A purely manual walk
// through a stash room while no engine is running never triggers a hide.
//
// Room set lives on CharacterProfile.StashRooms — the same list MovementFilter
// uses, populated by the right-click "Toggle: Stash room" on the Navigation map.
// The coin-type filter (StashCoinCutoff) lives on CashSettings so the rule applies
// uniformly across every stash room (no per-room rules).
//
// Stash rooms hold cash and items (banks are cash-only): every carried, unworn
// item whose game-data AutoStash flag is set is hidden by its canonical name. The
// per-item opt-in comes from the injected resolver, which reads the 4-tier
// ItemOverlay override.
//
// Master gate: AutoActionDefaults.AutoGetCash — same toggle as CashManager. Item
// stashing rides the same gate: a stash is one operation ("dump my excess cash
// and my auto-stash items"), not two independently toggled behaviours.
