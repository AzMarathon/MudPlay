// Carries a stash room's coin to a bank: walk to the stash, search, take what the
// cash settings let us carry, walk to the bank, deposit it, and go back for more
// until the search shows nothing left. It ends in the bank after the last deposit.
//
// A stash is a belief until it is searched (StashLedger): anyone can have drawn on
// it, and a pile is bigger than one trip can carry. So every trip searches again
// and reads the pile before taking anything, and the ledger is set to what the
// search showed less what was taken (GAME_MECHANICS "Hiding coin in a room
// (stashing)": the untaken part of a searched pile stays hidden).
//
// Each deposit is everything carried above the Settings → Cash keep-on-hand
// amount, the same rule every other deposit follows: the stash's coin, whatever
// was picked up off the ground between the two rooms, and what was already in the
// purse (report paradigm-20261002-111650: keeping the purse as it stood at the
// start left earlier pickups unbanked trip after trip).
//
// A purse that is already loaded goes to the bank first: started with more coin
// than there is room left for (a transfer cut off on its way to the bank and
// started again, report paradigm-20261002-114620), or found unable to take
// anything at the stash while it still holds coin to bank.
//
// A party leader can have the members carry too (Settings → Cash): once the
// leader has taken its own load, each member is telepathed `@get-stash` — search
// and take coin up to your own weight limits (GetStashHandler) — and
// `@deposit-all` at the bank. A search shows hidden coin only to the searcher, so
// the members can't be handed what the leader saw. Each member's reply says it is
// done, and once all have answered (or the wait runs out) the run moves on; what
// they took isn't read from the reply — a second search counts what is left.
//
// Walker, wire and collect engine are reached through delegates, like
// TrainFundingRouter, so the trips can be unit-tested without a map.
