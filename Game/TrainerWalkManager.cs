// The manual / armed entry point for "go train". Resolves the nearest
// allowed, level-appropriate trainer (TrainerCatalog.SelectNearest + BFS
// distance), detours a running loop / auto-lair to it, sends train on arrival,
// and — once a train-success line confirms the level-up (stock "attain level N"
// or the level-less Paradigm "train to the next level" wording) — refreshes
// stats and hands off to AutoTrainManager to apply the CP plan, then resumes
// the engine.
//
// Can-level detection without polling. PlayerStats.Exp is the live experience
// total — StatParser re-anchors it on every stat/exp poll and accrues each
// "You gain N experience." line. "Can train" is that total meeting the next
// level's cumulative threshold (ExperienceTableCalculator.CalcExpNeeded) —
// exactly the top Level-Projection row's Exp to level hitting 0. We watch
// PlayerStats.PropertyChanged, so a kill that crosses the threshold fires the
// armed run immediately; no exp poll.
//
// Engine detour mirrors AutoDepositManager: snapshot the running Loop /
// Auto-Lair, stop it (stop-and-restart, not a gate, so the detour walk owns
// the wire), train, then restart it. Manual Train Now does the same when an
// engine is running; with none it just walks + trains. Both the armed run and
// Train Now stop once only AutoTrainerSettings.LevelsToKeep bankable levels
// remain (the reserve), and both gate the CP-apply on the Auto-train-stats
// toggle. The one always-applies path is the Train Now CP-only reconcile
// (SetCpSpendConfirm): when no banked level is left to train but the current
// level has an unapplied, affordable plan raise, it prompts and — on yes —
// allocates CP without a fresh level-up.
