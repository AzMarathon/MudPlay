// What a set of the character's OWN buffs adds to their offense — Stealth,
// accuracy, the backstab bonuses, +max damage and crits — for the Monster Intel
// "Apply Buffs" what-if (e.g. a Gypsy's shadowform). The offense mirror of
// BuffDefenseCalculator, with the same rule for a 0 AbilVal: the magnitude comes
// from the spell's level-scaled affect range (shadowform at level 8 = 5 + 8/3 = 7,
// matching the live `stat` jump from 83 to 90 Stealth).
//
// Stealth shows in `stat` while the buff is up (user-confirmed), so the live
// Stealth already carries an active buff — counting it again would double it.
// Its Stealth is therefore folded only while it ISN'T up; the rest (accuracy,
// backstab bonuses, damage, crits) come from the gear aggregate, which never
// sees buffs, so they always fold.
//
// Ability 1 is deliberately absent: on a spell it's the damage marker, not the
// +min damage it means on gear.
