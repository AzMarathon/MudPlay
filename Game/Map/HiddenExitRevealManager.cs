// Drives the walker's sea <dir> retry loop for searchable-hidden exits.
// Mirrors DoorOpenManager's shape — one request in flight, FIFO queue,
// single terminal HiddenSearchResult callback per request — but with a
// different revelation signal: the watcher subscribes to
// RoomTracker.StateChanged and inspects the new current room's exit map
// for the searched direction. When the direction appears, the exit is
// "revealed" and the manager fires Revealed.
//
// This is the targeted reveal loop, distinct from the no-arg-sea
// auto-search-room feature. The attempt cap reads live from
// Settings.Other.MaxHiddenSearchAttempts on each retry so the user can
// tune mid-session.
//
// The game won't search while you're blind — `sea` answers only "You are
// blind." — so a search waits out the blindness (OnBlindnessChanged) instead of
// burning attempts or hanging on a reply that never comes.
