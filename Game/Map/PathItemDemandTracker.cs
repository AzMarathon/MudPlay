// Bridges the walker's planned-route item requirements to the NeedsRegistry as
// NeedKind.PathItem needs, and resolves them when the required item enters
// inventory. Backs the Settings → Other "search rooms if item needed"
// affordance: while any PathItem need is outstanding (and the feature is on),
// AutoSearchManager arms itself so every room entry issues a bare "sea",
// revealing the concealed item that unlocks the route.
//
// At walk-start the walker announces every item id gating an (Item: N) /
// (Ticket: N) exit along the planned path (see
// AutoWalkManager.SetPathItemAnnouncer). This tracker posts a need for each
// such item we don't already carry; a need is resolved the moment that item
// appears in inventory (OnInventoryChanged, wired to InventoryManager.Changed).
// Posting is deduped by the registry, so re-announcing the same route is a
// no-op.
//
// This tracker only posts and resolves — the fulfillers react off the
// registry: PartyPathItemGate (party give / provision), PathItemShopRouter (buy
// the shortfall at a shop), and MonsterDropRouter (reroute for a drop-only
// item), plus the armed room search that reveals it off the floor. Riding the
// registry rather than a bespoke flag is what lets those claimants coordinate
// on the same need. Needs are dropped on character swap by the registry's Clear
// (wired in AppServices).
//
// Inventory is reached through delegates rather than the concrete
// InventoryManager / ItemNameStore so the post/resolve logic stays
// unit-testable without a live line stream + game-data load. Each delegate has
// exactly one production binding in AppServices.
