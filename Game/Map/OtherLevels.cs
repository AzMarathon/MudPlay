// The floors reachable through up/down exits from a planar layout, placed on that
// layout's grid so the map can show them dimmed beside the current floor: a
// mountain path that climbs and drops reads as one path instead of a redraw per
// level.
//
// A floor reached by an up/down exit is shifted so the room the exit leads to sits
// on the cell of the room it leaves: straight above or below it, as the game has
// it.
//
// Which exit a floor hangs from matters, because the game's geography doesn't add
// up: two chains of stairs between the same pair of floors rarely agree on where
// one sits over the other. Every floor walked across on the way adds its own
// bends, so a floor is hung from the chain that crosses the least ground on the
// floors between: a shaft of single rooms costs nothing however deep it goes, a
// route through a reef and an underground lake costs their width. The chain with
// the fewest floors used to win, and put the old world on top of the new lands by
// way of the lagoon instead of beside them by way of the Frozen Cavern's shaft
// (user, 2026-10-03). Floors the current one leads to directly cross no ground at
// all, and hang from the first exit in room order.
//
// A floor's elevation still counts the fewest up/down steps to it (+1 per up, -1
// per down), and only floors within maxLevels of the current one are drawn — a
// floor placed by way of a deep shaft is no further away for it.
//
// Where floors share a cell it reads as a view from above: every floor above the
// current one claims cells before any floor below it, nearest first on each side.
// A cave or volcano below never covers the trail climbing over it, however early
// it's found (user, 2026-10-02). The current floor is never covered.
//
// A floor that would land mostly on cells already drawn is a different place
// stacked over this one (a volcano under the hills, barracks under a trail), and
// mixing it in only clutters the map, so past maxOverlap it is left out (user,
// 2026-10-02). It is weighed on its own: a mountain path is a chain of small
// floors, and dropping everything beyond one crowded landing would cut the path.
//
// Showing only the floors above (or below) still searches through both: a floor
// above can be reached by a path that dips first. The other side is dropped
// before it claims any cell. A floor level with the current one (up, then back
// down somewhere else) is on neither side and is drawn either way.
