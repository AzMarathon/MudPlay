// What the leader's client has handed to party members for a gate, kept while the
// party lasts. A joined member who doesn't answer the @have count is taken to hold
// none, so the leader fetches a copy and hands it over. With nothing kept, the same
// member was fetched another copy on every trip through the gate, though they held
// the one from the trip before. So a hand-over the game confirmed is remembered,
// and a member who stays silent at a later count is credited with it (user,
// 2026-10-09). The cost the user accepted: a hand-over that was confirmed and then
// didn't stick is not made again until the party changes.
//
// Only what the game confirmed. The leader's own `give` is noted when it goes out
// and remembered when the game's line comes back naming that item and that member.
// A give the game refused leaves nothing, and neither does one a member was told
// to make (`@do give`): its line goes to that member, not to the leader.
//
// A member's own word outranks it. An answer replaces what was remembered for that
// item, up or down, and it is the answer a later silence is credited with.
//
// An item with a limited number of uses. A gate may use such an item up, so the
// member holding it on the last trip says nothing about this one. Its hand-over is
// remembered for the trip it was made on and no further, and for less when the
// leader crosses an exit that needs the item before that trip ends. An item whose
// uses can't be read is treated the same way.
//
