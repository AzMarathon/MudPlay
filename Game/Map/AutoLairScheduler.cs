// Deterministic Auto-Lair target picker. Given a set of marked lairs
// (with their respawn timers + last-arrival timestamps), the current
// room, and a travel-cost model, returns the lair the player should
// approach next.
//
// Why deterministic: the user has told us which lairs they want and how
// often each respawns, so a uniform-random pick over the marked set
// wastes that information. This scheduler picks the lair whose entry
// timing minimises a configurable cost (wasted respawn vs idle wait).
//
// Entry-triggered respawn: in MajorMUD the lair's respawn counter
// doesn't tick until the player enters. The scheduler treats
// LairCandidate.ReadyAt as "earliest time the room repopulates when
// re-entered" — i.e. LastEntered + RespawnSeconds. Never-entered lairs
// report ReadyAt = null and are treated as ready immediately.
//
// Scoring: per candidate, the scheduler computes slack = entryArrival -
// readyAt.
//   slack > 0 ⇒ slack seconds of wasted respawn (the mob has been up
//               that long when we step in).
//   slack < 0 ⇒ |slack| seconds of idle wait in the wait-room before
//               stepping in.
// Default heuristic minimises max(0, slack) + max(0, -slack) * idlePenalty;
// throughput heuristic minimises max(0, slack) only (idle time is free).
// idlePenalty defaults to 1.0 (treat early and late equally).
//
// Wait-room contract: the caller is responsible for picking the
// wait-room (the BFS-shortest neighbour of the lair that isn't itself a
// marked lair, and isn't avoided). The scheduler scores against the
// wait-room hop count, not the lair's own hop count, because the player
// must NOT enter the lair early — the respawn check only fires on entry.
// The single entry hop is added in via ITravelCostModel.EntryHopDuration.

    // candidates: one entry per marked lair, with the pre-computed
    //   wait-room + approach hop count + ready-at timestamp. Entries with

    //   no eligible wait-room).
