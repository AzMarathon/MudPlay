// Base auto-search engine — issues a room-wide `sea` to reveal concealed items,
// which then surface on the "You notice ... here." survey line and are picked up
// by AutoGetItemsManager / CashManager exactly as visible loot would be.
//
// Combat sequencing: a `search` won't run while you're fighting, so firing on
// bare room entry (as this used to) sent the `sea` into the middle of the attack
// announcements, where it was lost. The search now waits for the room to be clear
// of engageable hostiles:
//   - Entry with NO fight → search on entry as before, after a short classify
//     delay. Room entry fires before the "Also here:" occupant line is parsed, so
//     at the entry instant an empty room and a fight-about-to-start look
//     identical; the delay lets the occupants reveal first.
//   - Entry WITH a fight → the search is deferred and the Search movement gate is
//     held so the walker can't leave; when the room clears the `sea` fires and the
//     gate stays held a settle window so the revealed survey comes back and the
//     get engines collect it BEFORE the loop sneaks (pre-move hook) and steps on.
//
// Driven from two seams (wired in AppServices): RoomTracker.StateChanged
// (OnRoomChanged — resets per-room state) and RoomEntityClassifier.EntitiesObserved
// (OnRoomObserved — wired after the combat tracker so the hostile check is current).
//
// This is the whole-room scan, distinct from HiddenExitRevealManager's targeted
// sea <dir> retry loop. The two are complementary and never contend.
//
// Two independent gates arm the search: the persisted master toggle (AutoSearch)
// and a transient path-item demand gate. Either issues the search; the demand
// gate never mutates the persisted flag.
