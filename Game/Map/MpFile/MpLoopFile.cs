// map: the file carries no (map, room), only per-step hashExits tokens, so
// MpFileImporter walks the steps through the graph to find the actual rooms.
//
// Label is the first bracket on line 1; Author the second (a second [label][author]
// line, which some files carry, fills an empty author). Start / End are the header
// room lines ([code:group:name]); a single-header file uses the start for both.
// Use is the metadata field after the step count (always -1 in the files seen; not
// named in MegaMUD's help); Gold, RequiredItem, FailPath and SuccessPath are the
// path-details fields MegaMUD's help documents. Problems lists anything malformed
// that didn't stop the decode — the review window shows it rather than refusing
// the file.
