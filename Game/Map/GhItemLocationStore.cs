// an Inventory-only lap, or the post-sort final recon pass); read by
// RoombaQueryHandler to answer @roomba <item>. Realm-scoped for the same reason
// GhRoomLabelStore is — one shared gang house per realm, so a sighting recorded
// by any character is visible to every other character on that realm. Mirrors
// RoomBlacklistStore's per-realm load/persist shape (OnRealmChanged + a Changed
// event).
//
// Keyed two levels deep — canonical item name, then RoomKey — because a gang
// house can legitimately stock the same item in several rooms at once (e.g.
// torches in both a lighting-supplies room and a catch-all overflow room); a
// query needs every room a sweep actually found it in, not just whichever was
