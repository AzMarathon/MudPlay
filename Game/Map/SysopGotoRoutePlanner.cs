// A sysop-goto routing shortcut: fire `sys goto <name>` to land at a curated
// location, then walk the land leg from there to the goal. The jump is instant
// from anywhere, so — unlike a boat, which has a leg to the dock — there is no
// leg BEFORE the jump; only the landing→destination leg counts toward "which
// route is shorter". That land-hop count is the cost proxy the walker weighs
// against a pure land route (see AutoWalkManager.ChooseSysGotoRoute).

// The sys-goto analogue of BoatRoutePlanner. A sys goto is an origin-independent
// teleport, so it can't be a graph edge on every room (each room has exactly one
// Direction.Teleport slot) — this side planner bridges the gap by BFS-routing each
// usable location's landing room to the goal and keeping the location whose land
// leg is shortest. Locations come from the live SysopGoto table (empty when the
// power is off, so the planner then finds nothing), and the level gate is honoured
// at planning time: unlike a manual fire (which trusts the user), the router
// EXCLUDES a level-gated location when the character's level is unknown or too low
// — auto-routing must never silently take a shortcut that could be lethal.
