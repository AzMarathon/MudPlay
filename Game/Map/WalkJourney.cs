// Where a trip is going and how it was told to get there. The walker plans one leg
// at a time and forgets a leg's settings when the leg ends, but a trip is often
// several legs: a re-plan, a side trip to fetch an item the route needs, a restart
// after a sell or a flee. Each of those is planned from this, so the route the user
// picked on a card is still the route after the third leg.
//
// PreferTeleportFree null is a walk nobody chose a route for, which follows the
// automatic-walk teleport setting. ClosedGates are gate items a plan through the
// acquirable gates must not count as in hand: the picked route goes round the exits
// that need them.
//
// AgreedHazardRooms are the hazard rooms, uncountered when the route was shown, that
// lie on the card's route. Picking the card agreed to walking into those. It did not
// agree to any other hazard room, so they are named one by one: a plan made later
// from another room opens these and nothing else. A picked route that names none
// agreed to none.
