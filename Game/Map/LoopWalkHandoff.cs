// meanwhile and hands it to the loop runner the moment the walk arrives at the loop
// room it was heading for: from there the run is the loop engine's (user, 2026-10-07).
//
// It is dropped, and no loop starts, when the walk can't get there, the user stops,
// picks a walk that ends somewhere else (running to a blocked room, a shop stop), or
// starts something else first.
