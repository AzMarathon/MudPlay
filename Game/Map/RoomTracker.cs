// Trust-by-default room-tracking FSM. Maintains RoomState from the four signals
// every player session produces: outgoing move commands, observed room
// displays, observed move refusals, and the user's manual "I am here" override.
//
// State semantics:
//   - Unknown — fresh tracker, no observation yet.
//   - Confirmed — current room is trusted.
//   - Pending — one or more moves sent, awaiting confirmation.
//   - Suspect — observation didn't line up; current room preserved as best
//     guess; counter incremented. Internal-only, no UI churn.
//   - Lost — replay-from-last-Confirmed failed; user must manually pick or wait
//     for a confirming observation.
//
// Recovery: a single tier — replay the persisted CharacterProfile.RecentSteps
// from the last Confirmed room through the graph; if the endpoint matches the
// current observation, we Confirm there. No fuzzy footprint matching.
//
// Persistence: CharacterProfile.LastKnownRoom is written ONLY on strict-1-of-1
// Confirmed transitions (FindCandidates(name, exits).Count == 1) and on the
// user's manual locate. Predicted-neighbour / null-name-learned /
// replay-recovery Confirmed transitions update in-memory state but don't
// overwrite the on-disk anchor — the existing anchor is a stronger trust signal
// than any deduction. This is the contract the engine-level recovery gate
// relies on for tier-3 backtrack: the persisted anchor is always something we
// KNEW, not something we deduced. Every NoteMoveSent appends a step. The profile
