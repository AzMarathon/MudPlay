// Keeps the in-game statline aligned with the Settings → Statline editor for
// the whole session. The editor command is the single source of truth: it's
// what we send to the BBS via set statline and what
// StatlinePromptRegexBuilder compiles the prompt parser from. When the live
// prompt doesn't match the editor's shape — the scanner fires
// PromptShapeUnmatched — this resends set statline <editor> so the editor
// always wins, never the other way around.
//
// Armed unconditionally on every Connected — unlike the auto-login and
// main-menu engines, which gate on the user having configured automation. The
// statline must reconcile whether or not login was automated. Verification
// always runs; the resend is mismatch-gated, so a session already on the
// editor's statline (persisted from a prior session) sends nothing.
//
// Default-statline users reconcile too (the resend is `set statline full`):
// a server whose class default isn't one of the stock shapes — or a statline
// the player set by hand in-game, even plain text with no numbers — leaves the
// Default parser reading nothing, so HP sits at 0 and every HP-gated engine
// stalls (report `stock-20260929-111956`).
//
// Mismatches only count once we're in the game (a room display has been seen
// since Arm) so BBS menus before login can never trigger a send, and only a
// run of MismatchThreshold of them in a row acts, so one garbled or stray
// bracketed line can't. Any matching prompt breaks the run.
//
// Reactive, not timer-driven: each confirmed run drives one reconcile attempt,
// paced by RetryDelay so the burst of in-flight prompts arriving between our
// send and the server applying it doesn't trigger duplicate sends. Bounded by
// MaxRetries so a statline the server won't take stops resending rather than
// hammering the wire. A matching prompt latches IsSynced and ends the run; a
// later run (the statline changed in-game mid-session) gets its own resends.
//
// When the resends run out and the prompt still doesn't match, the mismatch is
// flagged (FlagChanged) so the user is told — HP can't be read, and nothing
// else would say so. The flag outlives a reconnect and clears on the first
// matching prompt.
