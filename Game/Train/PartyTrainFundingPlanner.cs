// Decides how the party pays for a trip, in the user's order:
//
//   1. Everyone's purse covers their own train → nothing to do.
//   2. The party's spare coin covers every shortfall → share it (gives happen where
//      the party already stands; no detour).
//   3. Otherwise → one bank stop. A short member with enough on deposit at that
//      branch withdraws its own shortfall ("covers its own fee"); the branch chosen
//      is the one that covers the most shortfall. Anyone still short is covered from
//      the party's spare as far as it goes, and whoever's left sits the trip out.
//
// A withdraw only works at a branch you hold a deposit at, so each member reports
// its largest single branch; a member whose money is at a different branch than the
// stop can't draw there and falls through to sharing.
//
// Pure — no wire, no map — so the whole table is unit-testable.
