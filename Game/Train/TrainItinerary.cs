// A trainer serves a contiguous level band, so a character sitting at the top of
// one band can only be taken as far as that band's ceiling: at level 9 with two
// levels banked, a 1-10 trainer gets us to 10 and then refuses, because
// ServesLevel is false the moment MaxLVL <= level. The run has to walk on to
// whichever trainer covers 11 and finish there.
//
// Planning that chain up front — rather than discovering it as a "You have
// progressed too far" rejection mid-run — is also what makes the money question
// answerable: each trainer charges its own Markup%, so the bill for the whole
// chain can only be priced once the chain is known.
//
// Pure: the caller injects the distance metric, so the whole split is testable
// without a map.
