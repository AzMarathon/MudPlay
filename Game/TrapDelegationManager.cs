// Party-member trap delegation. When the walker hits a trapped exit and the
// LOCAL character can't disarm it, but a party member can, this manager says
// @trap <dir> to the room and resumes the walk on what the party answers.
//
// The exchange (user, 2026-10-09): a client that takes the trap answers at once
// with TrapReply.Attempting, which is how we know someone has it; it then disarms
// (resting first if the trap put it under its rest threshold) and says the result.
// The first member to report the exit clear resumes the walk. A member who gives
// up only ends it when no other member that accepted is still working. If nobody
// accepts inside AcceptWindow, nobody is going to (the capable member isn't running
// this client, hasn't granted the command, or isn't in the room), and the walk is
// told so instead of waiting on an answer that will never come.
//
// Answers are read from say and from telepath: a sneaking member's replies are
// moved to telepath so they don't break its sneak.
//
// Signal separation (architectural guardrail): the LOCAL self-disarm path keys
// exclusively on the game's own first-person disarm signals via
// TrapDisarmManager — it never watches chat. This manager is the ONLY consumer of
// remote replies, and only for the delegation branch. The two paths converge on
// the walker's single OnTrapReply callback but their signal SOURCES stay distinct.
//
// Capability check (per the trap-capability ability codes in
// AbilityNames.HasTrapAbility): a member's CLASS is the main gate — its Classes
// row is scanned for a trap-skill grant. RACE is secondary, consulted only when
// we actually know the member's race (a "shadowy figure" look leaves it unknown,
// so we don't assume). Race for a joined member comes from the PlayerDatabase;
// if it's missing we look at them once on join to capture it (GreetManager skips
// party members, so the look has to originate here).
