// The character a ranking was made for, as the simulator read it: one short hash
// for each group of inputs, so a ranking listed again later can say which groups
// are no longer what they were. A ranking whose character has changed is still a
// ranking of that character, of an earlier state of it: it is listed, marked.
//
// Three groups come from the SimCharacter the simulation played, so they cover what
// the simulator reads and nothing it doesn't (encumbrance, for one, only through
// what it does to the swings):
//   stats or gear     level, pools, the melee and defence profiles, regen, alignment,
//                     the Default-gear basis and the backstab opener
//   spells            every spell known, with its figures at that level
//   settings          the Combat (less what the simulator doesn't read), Health and
//                     Spells sections, the buff list, and the hang-up switch
// Two are handed in, being about the game data and the map and not the character
// record:
//   game-data edits   the user's record overrides at every tier (Game Data Browser)
//   reach             what decides which areas can be walked to, as far as it holds
//                     still: avoided and blacklisted rooms, class and race, gate
//                     items carried (RankingReach)
// The purse and the walk pace are left out: they move with every kill and every
// item picked up, and a ranking marked for them would always be marked.
//
// The user's own loops in a ranking are compared too, but apart from these, loop by
// loop (RankingLoops): they are not the character's, and the check names them.
