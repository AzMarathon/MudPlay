// Owns PlayerState.InCombat and the Combat gate on MovementCoordinator.
// Subscribes to RoomEntityClassifier.EntitiesObserved for the gate's room-clear
// logic and to combat-line patterns for the PlayerState.InCombat flag.
//
// Gate semantics: the MovementCoordinator.CombatGate is held while the current
// room contains at least one classified monster the user is configured to
// engage. "Engageable" is resolved from the monster's overlay relationship (see
// IsEngageable) — shopkeepers and quest-givers are marked Friend / Neutral and
// don't hold the gate.
//
// Plus a master switch: isAutoAttackEnabled short-circuits the gate to
// never-assert when off, so a fresh character (default
// CombatSettings.MasterAutoAttackEnabled = false) walks through every room
// unimpeded until the user opts in.
//
// PlayerState.InCombat flips true on CombatStatus Engaged OR UserHits OR MobHits
// OR MobMisses. It does NOT flip false on CombatStatus Off — see
// OnCombatStatus. The authoritative end-of-combat signal is the room going clear
// of engageable monsters (OnEntitiesObserved's "room cleared" branch).
