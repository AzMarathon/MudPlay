// Engages a monster that shares a dark room with us — one the normal room
// display can't reveal. A room too dark to see in prints only "The room is very
// dark..." / "The room is pitch black..." with no name, no exits, and crucially
// no "Also here:" line (see GAME_MECHANICS.md), so RoomEntityClassifier never
// learns the hostile is present and auto-combat sits idle while the mob swings.
//
// Three things leak through the darkness, and each is a reveal:
//
//   attacks   a line whose shape is combat and nothing else — an article plus
//             "at you", or "you for N damage". Acted on the first time it is
//             seen.
//   swings    the same attacker swinging at us twice inside one round. This one
//             is article-OPTIONAL, which is how a monster with a proper name is
//             caught, and that looseness is why one is not enough: the shape is
//             also the shape of "The barmaid smiles at you." A repeat is
//             evidence, because a monster names itself on every swing while an
//             emote says its line once.
//   party     a party member's "<player> moves to attack <monster>." announce.
//             A same-room broadcast (GAME_MECHANICS.md), so a monster a party
//             member engages here shares our room even though the display never
//             named it, and it usually arrives a round before the mob first
//             swings at us.
//
// THE NAME IS READ OFF THE LINE, NOT OUT OF THE PATTERN. The attacker's name is
// followed by its own verb phrase from the .mdb and nothing marks the boundary,
// so a capture group guesses: MobHits reads "The bugbear captain all-out cleaves
// you for 20 damage!" as the name "bugbear captain all-out". Instead every
// word-prefix of the line is offered to the classifier and the longest one it
// recognises wins. The leading article is optional because a monster with a
// proper name is printed without one.
//
// Injecting the resolved monster into the classifier's observation — rather than
// sending an attack — is what keeps this honest: CombatManager then engages it
// by name through the same hostility filter and Target Order a lit-room "Also
// here:" monster goes through, so a non-hostile that trips a trigger is dropped
// instead of swung at, and an attacker that resolves to nothing is left alone.
//
// Scope guard: everything here is gated on RoomTracker.IsInDarkRoom. In a lit
// room the "Also here:" line already lists occupants and the normal classifier /
// death-watcher pipeline keeps the target list honest, so this watcher must
// never fabricate a target there — it has no retraction path of its own beyond
// the one below, and a phantom in a lit room would never be withdrawn.
//
// RETRACTION LISTENS FOR BOTH REFUSALS. A target that died unseen or left leaves
// the roster only when the server says so, and it says so two ways: "Your
// command had no effect." and "You don't see <X> here!" (also spelled "You do
// not see <X> here!"). Missing the second one strands a dark-room target
// permanently — nothing withdraws it, so AlreadyPresent below suppresses every
// later reveal and the room stays unfought while the mob swings.
