// Recognises monster deaths from the always-present exp signal. A kill prints, in a
// fixed order, the monster's death-flavor line → "You gain N experience." → *Combat
// Off*. The exp line is the reliable, monster-agnostic kill signal (see GAME_MECHANICS
// "Monster-kill message order"): an exp gain followed by a *Combat Off* within a short
// window is a death. Fires MonsterDied with IsFallback = true and no Candidates —
// consumers attribute the kill to whatever they were fighting
// (CombatManager.CurrentTarget) and force a roster re-display to pick the survivor.
//
// Not every *Combat Off* inside the window is the kill's. On Paradigm a room spell
// that leaves a survivor prints its kills' exp lines and no Off at all, and the next
// Off is then whatever command stops that spell: the attack sent at the survivor, a
// cast, a `break`. CommandOffProbe names those, and they are not deaths.
//
// Those kills are deaths all the same, and are raised on their exp lines by the one
// party that knows a room spell of ours made them: CombatManager, through
// NoteRoomSpellKill. A kill is then counted when it happens, not when the last
// monster of the room dies or some later Off happens to fall inside the window.
//
// Per-monster death MESSAGES were retired: they're arbitrary per-monster flavor with
// no shared keyword and no distinctive colour, so a generic wording/colour matcher is
// infeasible. The exp line is the only reliable generic signal, and our own targeting
// names the mob — so the per-monster DeathLine data bought nothing and is gone.
