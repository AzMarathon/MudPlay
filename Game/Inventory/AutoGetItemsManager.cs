// Auto-get items engine. Parses the room "You notice <list> here." survey
// line, resolves each entry against game data, and sends get <item name> for
// any item flagged ItemOverlay.AutoCollect.
//
// There is no bulk "get all" verb in MajorMUD — each item is collected
// individually by name. Every entry the survey line names is run through the
// injected resolver, which maps the loose room wording back to an item Number
// and reads its per-character AutoCollect override. Non-items (cash entries,
// scenery) and items not flagged for collection are skipped.
//
// Collect-after-combat: when CashSettings.CollectAfterCombatFinished is set
// (the shared Cash + Items timing toggle) and the room still holds engageable
// hostiles, the gets are queued and flushed on OnRoomObserved once combat
// clears (no engageable hostiles remain). When the toggle is off, or no
// hostiles are present, the gets fire immediately. A room change (OnRoomChanged)
// discards any un-flushed queue — those items belong to a room we've left.
//
// Movement gate: collecting (or deferring) items asserts the shared
// AcquisitionGate so the walker holds until get-clear — deferred items hold the
// gate before CombatStateTracker clears the Combat gate, defeating the
// synchronous walker-resume race; immediate gets hold it until the `You took`
// confirmations land (settle window as fallback). Bound via SetAcquisitionGate
// (optional — unbound, the engine doesn't gate movement).
//
// Master switch: AutoActionDefaults.AutoGetItems (shared with the Settings →
// General toggle and the toolbar Toggle command).
//
// Not yet handled: needs-fulfillment (grabbing a torch to satisfy a LightSource
// need), encumbrance gating, batching, and party provisioning.
