// Auto-discard items engine. When the pack holds an item flagged
// ItemOverlay.AutoDiscard above its keep floor, offloads the excess with
// drop <item name> — or hide <item name> when HideMode is set (OtherSettings
// "hide when discarding") — one counted command on Paradigm, one command per
// copy on Stock. The keep floor is MinToKeep when MustHaveMinimum is set; otherwise
// zero, so an unbanded flagged item is discarded entirely (the confirmed
// "no band → discard all" rule). A LoyalItem is never discarded even if also
// flagged AutoDiscard — loyalty (never-drop) is the safety flag and wins the
// contradiction.
//
// Exists to clean up chest dumps — open chest pours a set of random items
// straight into inventory that the player can't refuse — and unwanted
// auto-collected loot.
//
// Trigger: InventoryManager.Changed (wired in AppServices to OnInventoryChanged).
// Every inventory change re-evaluates the carried list. Offloads the engine has
// sent but not yet seen confirmed are held in _inFlight (drops) or _hidesInFlight
// (hides) and subtracted from the live count, so the Changed events its own
// confirmations raise don't re-send. Own "You dropped X." lines clear the drop
// count via the PlayerDrops subscription; "You hid X." clears the hide count via
// UserHides. Other players' drops (same PlayerDrops pattern, alternate branch)
// are ignored.
//
// Each hide is also registered in _suppressLog so the transaction-history
// forwarder can tell a discard's hide from a genuine stash — it is a discard, not
// a "stashed" item, so TryConsumeSuppressedHide lets the forwarder drop that
// ledger row while manual / stash-room hides (never registered here) still record.
//
// The hide-or-drop choice is one decision for every discard, not only the
// engine's own: a surface that discards by hand (Chest Offload's Drop buttons)
// sends through EmitDiscard, so the setting covers it and its hides stay out of
// the stash ledger the same way.
//
// A hide the room has no room for (Stock only: its rooms cap their hidden items)
// keeps the item and is sent again in each new room the character enters until
// it lands (user, 2026-10-09). It is never turned into a drop. The hold is for a
// hide still wanted: selling the item, dropping it, hiding it by hand, or taking
// it off the Chest Offload list calls the hold off (ReleaseHeld), since by then
// any copy left in the pack may be one the player means to keep.
//
// A hide for a copy that isn't in the pack is worse than wasted: Stock's engine
// doesn't answer it, and the line then falls through to speech. So no hide goes
// out for more copies than are carried and not already spoken for, and whatever
// is still unanswered is forgotten on a death, a disconnect, a profile swap, and
// once two inventory reads pass with no discard traffic between them. After one
// of the first three nothing goes out until the pack has been read again.
//

// and Action-menu toggle the item engines share). Runs UI-thread only
// (MessageRouter + Inventory.Changed both marshal upstream), so the dictionaries
