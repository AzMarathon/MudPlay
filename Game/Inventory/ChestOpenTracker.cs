// TryOpenNow) — whether or not the window is up. An open reads the
// inventory (`i`), opens, and reads it again; only what that one open added joins
// the list (ChestLootLedger), and — when the character has it switched on — its
// contents and coin are said to the room so everyone there knows what dropped. Chests opened back to back add up without
// double counting: each open's before is the read after the last one. A second Open
// click while one is in flight waits its turn; a second chest typed open mid-flight
// joins whichever diff will see its loot. The list is saved on the character profile and
// stays until the items are sold, dropped, hidden, given away, or the player removes
// them, so closing the window (or the client) never loses it. The list is lowered
// here, on the game's own confirmations, and the window follows from ItemLeft: it
// is right whether or not the window is up. UI thread only: line and inventory
// events arrive through `post`.
