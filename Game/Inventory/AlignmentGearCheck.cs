// Asks the game for our alignment when our gear says the recorded one may be wrong.
// On Paradigm that's `pro` (its "EPs:" row is the exact number); on Stock it's
// `who` (Stock's `pro` doesn't show alignment). Either reply updates our recorded
// alignment and the Equipment Manager re-evaluates its blocks against it.
//
// Two kinds of trigger, no timers:
//  • The game says our alignment moved (RequestVerify): gear taken off us ("Your …
//    has been removed."), a wear refused, a victim's forgive, a dark cloud that took
//    us out of Good. The record is what's stale, so this checks whatever the sets say.
//  • A gear set disagrees with the record (RequestCheck): an item blocked on
//    alignment alone, or alignment-gated gear with no alignment known yet — raised
//    when a block appears, sets are edited, or a profile loads. Checks only while
//    the disagreement is there.
// One check at most a minute: the game strips gear one line per item.
//
// Checks only go out on a prompt, so nothing is sent before we're in the game.
