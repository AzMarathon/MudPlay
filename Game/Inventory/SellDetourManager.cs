// Sell detours. An item flagged "Make detours to sell this item" (with Auto-sell)
// that's carried above its "Detour to sell if above" count turns a running walk-to,
// loop or Auto-Lair aside to a shop that trades it: stop the engine, walk to the
// shop, let AutoSellManager sell there on arrival, then carry on — the walk-to
// resumes to its destination, a loop walks back to its nearest room and a lair to
// where it left off, and restarts (DetourResume, shared with the auto-deposit reroute).
//
// Shop choice: the shops the user ticked "Sell here" on the item (any that trade it
// when none are), and among those the one adding the fewest steps to the trip
// (PathItemShopRouter.TrySelectShop). No detour when the running engine reaches such
// a shop on its own — the walk ends there, the loop passes through it, or it's a
// marked lair room — since Auto-sell sells in passing. After one shop, a still-due
// item whose shops weren't tried yet sends the detour on to the next before heading
// back. A shop that refuses an item, or can't be reached, isn't tried for it again
// this session. One that just didn't sell it — Auto-sell had nothing to queue there,
// or no sale reply came — waits UnsoldRetry before it's tried again: that's no proof
// the shop won't buy it (report paradigm-20260929-060520 wrote a shop off for the
// session and ignored every later pickup).
//
// Single controller: it only starts when nothing else owns movement (the caller's
// blocked probe covers combat, party following and the other errand engines) and
// stands down if movement is stopped externally mid-detour. A walk sends its next
// step the moment a room confirms, so a detour that comes due mid-step holds the
// engine at the room it's entering (SellDetourGate) and takes over from there. UI
// thread only.
