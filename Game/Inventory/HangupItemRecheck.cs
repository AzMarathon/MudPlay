// Looks for what a penalised hang-up dropped, on the way back into the game. Some
// boards drop a few of a character's items on the floor of the room when the link
// goes down in a fight (GAME_MECHANICS "Hang-up / lost carrier"), and nothing
// printed on the next entry says which. So what is held is written to the profile
// while the character plays (StampForSave), and the next entry compares that list
// with the login's own inventory read: what is short and lying in the room is
// taken back.
//
// The pickup runs only on a realm whose settings say items are dropped (Settings →
// BBS, HangupPenaltyNotice.MaxItemsDropped), once per connection, takes back no
// more copies than those settings say were dropped, and has no part in deciding a
// hang-up.
//
// The order on the way in:
//   connect       — a list is stored for this realm and the realm drops items (or
//                   a death is in question, as described at the end): movement
//                   is held, so a loop that restarts on the first prompt can't
//                   walk out of the room before the check has run.
//   game entered  — wait for an inventory read. The login sends `i` itself; an
//                   entry made by hand gets one asked for after InventoryWaitTicks.
//   inventory in  — compare. Nothing short ends it. Otherwise the room is needed:
//                   the login's own display, or one bare Enter when none was read.
//   room known    — another room than the one the link dropped in ends it. Else a
//                   `get` for each short item the floor list shows, once any
//                   fight in the room is over.
//   gets answered — the gear set that was on is applied again when a piece of it
//                   came back, and the hold on movement is dropped.
//
// The hold never outlasts its reason. An entry or an inventory read that doesn't
// come in time gives it up, and so does Reset States; the list is kept, and the
// comparison still runs when the read arrives, without the hold, picking up only
// where the map is sure the character stands in the room it left the game in.
//
// Nothing is retried: one pass per connection, and what isn't on the floor then
// is logged as still missing and forgotten. Only a pass cut short by the link
// dropping again carries its unfound items over to the next connection.
//
// The same pass answers a second question first: did the hang-up kill the
// character? A board that penalises a hang-up kills a character that was dropped,
// or low enough for the HP it takes to drop it under the death threshold, after
// the link is gone, so no death line is ever seen (Recovery.HangupDeath has the
// rule). When the list says the character was that low and the realm penalises,
// the pass runs for that alone, item counts or not: at the inventory read it
// asks for a `stat` if none has given the lives, then judges. Only a life lost
// says "died". A death it finds is recorded as any other and ends the pass: what
// is missing then is a deathpile, Death Recovery's to fetch, and nothing here
// picks it up or calls it missing. When it can't tell, it says so once and
// records nothing.
//
// The question outlives the pass when the lives can't be had (Auto-All off, or
// the hold already given up): it stays open, without a hold and with nothing
// sent, and any `stat` read on the connection answers it. It is judged on what
// the entry showed (HP at the first prompt, the first inventory read), never on
// what the character has become by the time the answer arrives.
