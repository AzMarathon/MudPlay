// Knows whether the character is inside the game, for the two things that depend
// on it.
//
// A bug report copies the terminal only from the time spent in the game. A report
// carries the backscroll, and one made at login would otherwise carry the board's
// login screen with it: the account name as typed, and whatever the board shows
// around the password. The terminal, the Backscroll window and the Wire Inspector
// still show all of it; only what a report copies out of them is held to these
// stretches (user, 2026-10-08).
//
// And the client stands down at the board's menu. A character that typed `exit` is
// on the board's menu with the link still up, and every engine went on sending as if
// it were in the game: the party poll, a buff, `sn`, and `set statline full` each
// landed on the menu as a selection (report paradigm-20261008-125639). AtBoardMenu
// says so, and AppServices holds the engines on it.
//
// In: the first statline prompt (the same signal every other "are we in the game"
// latch uses). It is seen before the terminal draws the bytes that carried it, so
// the room the character lands in counts as in the game with it.
// Out: the link dropping, a new link starting, the realm's "Your character has been
// saved" on exit, or the board's main menu. The last two are read out of the chunk
// that carries them; the stretch ends where that chunk began, so the menu drawn
// with it isn't copied either. A chat line shaped like one of them can only cost the
// few rows before the next prompt opens it again.
