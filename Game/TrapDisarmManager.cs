// State machine that drives the auto-disarm flow for @trap <direction> remote
// commands and the walker's trapped exits. Owns the queue of pending requests
// and the telepath-the-sender-on-completion contract.
//
// One request is in flight at a time: Idle → DisarmPending → Idle per direction;
// later requests queue FIFO. A @trap stop aborts whatever's in flight, drains the
// queue, telepaths each queued sender that their trap was cancelled, and returns
// to State.Idle.
//
// Every request disarms directly with `disarm trap <dir>`: the game accepts it
// without searching for the trap first (GAME_MECHANICS "Exit traps — search and disarm"), so a
// confirming `search` would only waste rounds.
//
// The capability gate (CanDisarm) lives in this manager so the handler can
// interrogate it before deciding whether to enqueue or send a denial reply. It
// reads a positive parsed Traps stat OR a class/race game-data trap-skill grant,
// so a character whose Traps value isn't captured yet still counts as able. The
// handler also owns the channel-aware silence (Say/Gangpath when no skill →
// silent; Telepath → reply) since the channel context lives at handler dispatch
// time.
//
// An exit we disarmed ourselves stays down until the engine re-arms it (5 minutes
// on Stock, about 2 on Paradigm — GAME_MECHANICS "Exit traps — search and disarm"),
// so a request for it inside that window is answered clear without a disarm, which
// would cost a command and end the sneak. Only our own success starts the clock:
// "already disarmed" means someone else's timer, and we can't tell when it started.
//
// A request ends on a successful disarm, on a reply meaning there's no trap that
// way, or once MaxDisarmAttempts disarms have all failed.
//
// A trap's failure wording is per exit and the imported rooms don't carry it, so a
// trap we've never seen (Paradigm has more trapped exits than the Stock list covers)
// answers with a line nothing recognises. The reply watchdog treats silence as a
// trap that went off — retry, then stop the walk — and logs the lines that arrived,
// so the unknown wording shows up in the program log and the bug report.
