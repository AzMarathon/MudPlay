// In-memory store + dispatcher for the loaded character's ScheduledEvent
// entries. Owns the merge / save path against CharacterProfile.Events, exposes
// CRUD for the settings editor, reconciles saved-target references against
// LoopManager + LairManager, and runs fired events.
//
// A fired event is a RUN: its action goes until it's done, then its Then step
// (ScheduledEvent.ResolvedThen) decides what's next — nothing, go back to what
// was running, start a loop / auto-lair, walk somewhere, or fire another event.
// When an action is done depends on the action: a walk arrives, a command is
// sent, a wait / rest-up / Roomba sweep / bank trip ends, and a loop or
// auto-lair meets one of its stop-after rules (laps, minutes, a boss killed,
// conditions holding).
//
// One run at a time, start to finish, in the order the events fired (user,
// 2026-10-09: "if multiple events fire near same time, it handles them start to
// finish before the next one kicks in"; 2026-10-10: "if we set an event to loop
// 3 times then goto bank, that event should finish before any other events fire
// off ... then do the ones that triggered mid event, in order"). An event that
// fires while another's run is under way waits in a first-in first-out queue and
// starts when that run is over, its Then walk and any chain of Then → event
// included. Two things are not runs:
//   * A command event with nothing after it: it's sent and leaves whatever run
//     is going alone.
//   * A loop or auto-lair event with no stop-after rule. Nothing ends it, so
//     the event is finished the moment the loop has started, and the loop is
//     then simply what the character is doing: an event that fires later takes
//     over from it and goes back to it like any loop the user started.
//
// Only an event with the Logoff trigger jumps the queue (user, 2026-10-10: "an
// event that its 'when' is logoff, should fire immediately, all other events
// queue"; IsLogoffType). It starts at once, the run it interrupts is abandoned,
// and the events already waiting keep their places behind it; the connection it
// is racing would not wait for the run to end.
//
// A queued event starts as if it had fired the moment the run before it ended.
// When that run's Then would only leave an engine running (go back, start a loop
// or auto-lair), the engine isn't started to be stopped again in the same breath:
// the queued event takes it as its own Resume target, so "go back to what was
// running" happens once, after the last of them.
//
// A run the user takes over — they stop its walk / loop / auto-lair, press Stop
// while it waits or rests, or start something of their own meanwhile — ends
// without its Then and empties the queue: the user said stop. So do a death and
// Reset States. A stop by something that brings the engine back itself (a bank or
// sell trip, a flee, a trainer or comeback detour, the loop's own restart after a
// reconnect: LoopEvent.WillResume and its walker / auto-lair twins) is not the
// user's: the run is suspended, keeps its lap count and stop rule, and goes on
// when the engine is back.
//
// A dropped connection ends nothing by itself (user, 2026-10-10: the waiting
// events "should still be waiting after a reconnect"). The queue is kept, its
// wait clocks running; nothing is checked, finished or started while the link is
// down, and it all picks up at the first prompt back in the game. The run that
// was under way lives or dies with its engine: a loop restarts itself and the run
// with it, a walk the drop didn't stop goes on, and a run whose engine is stopped
// during the outage ends without its Then, the next waiting event starting once
// back in. A walk frozen on a movement gate (the user's Pause, Auto-All off)
// holds its run the same way, and the wait limit is what keeps a long freeze or
// outage from piling events up.
//
// Engines raise their Failed and Finished from the middle of their own teardown
// (the walker raises Failed and only then resets). What ends a run is therefore
// posted (Later), never done inside the raise: a walk the next event started there
// would be wiped by the reset that follows.
//
// Saved-target reconciliation: subscribes to LoopManager.LoopsChanged +
// LairManager.SetupsChanged. On either, walks every event whose ActionType is
// Loop or AutoLair and auto-disables any whose referenced name is no longer in
// the corresponding manager's collection. Auto-disable is sticky: re-creating a
// same-named target later doesn't auto-restore — the user re-enables manually
// after confirming the new target matches their intent.
//
// Threading: profile lifecycle, manager-change and engine events fire on the UI
// thread (the producers marshal upstream), as do the trigger sources that call
// Fire and the run ticker (a DispatcherTimer), so no internal locking is needed.
