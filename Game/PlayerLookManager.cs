// Reactive `look <player>` automation — two independent Settings → Talk toggles,
// both off by default:
//
//  • LookBackWhenLookedAt — when the wire shows "<name> is looking at you.", we
//    send `look <name>` back.
//
// BOTH TOGGLES ARE ONCE PER PLAYER PER LOCAL-CALENDAR DAY, on the same rule
// and the same clock GreetManager uses (PlayerObservation.LastLookedUtc via
// PlayerDatabase.GetLastLookedUtc / RecordLooked, local midnight to local
// midnight). A look tells us race, class and loadout, and none of those change
// often enough to be worth re-asking inside a day.
//
// THE LOOK-BACK USED TO HAVE NO DEDUP AT ALL, on the reasoning that "a look-at
// is a deliberate social poke and mirroring it each time is the point". That
// holds for a person; it does not hold for two clients. With the box ticked on
// both sides it is an unconditional mutual mirror and it never terminates:
//
//     A looks at B  ->  server tells B  ->  B looks back at A
//                   ->  server tells A  ->  A looks back at B  ->  ...
//
// Reported from a live pair looking at each other non-stop. The arrival toggle
// only lights the fuse; the look-back is the engine, so the throttle has to
// cover it too or the loop survives.
//
// STAMPED ON SEND, not on a parsed reply — a look at someone we cannot resolve
// (a shadowy figure, a truncated block) must still count, or the throttle would
// never engage for exactly the players it can learn nothing from.
//
//  • LookAtPlayersOnArrival — when a non-party player walks into our room, we
//    send `look <name>` to learn/refresh their kit. Driven off
//    RoomEntryWatcher.ArrivalObserved (fires per arrival with the entity already
//    classified Player/Monster), so monsters and "Also here:" re-displays don't
//    trip it. Once per arrival — the watcher fires once per walk-in.
//
// Both address players by GIVEN name (MajorMUD targets `look` by the first name
// token) and skip our own character. The arrival path also skips current party
// members; the look-back path mirrors whoever looked, party or not.
//
// Off by default — each flag is pushed in from its Settings → Talk checkbox. The
// wire-sender is bound by MainWindowViewModel after telnet connects; before that
// the manager observes but can't send.
