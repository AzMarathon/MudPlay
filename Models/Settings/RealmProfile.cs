// time, currency name) lives here, and everything the client collects while playing it (players
// seen, blacklist, leaderboard, roomba, quests, realm-tier game-data edits, boss
// timers) is stored in its folder (AppPaths.RealmFolder). Character profiles are
// assigned to a realm by name (CharacterProfile.Realm); characters on the same
