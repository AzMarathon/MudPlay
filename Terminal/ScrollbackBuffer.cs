// Capacity-tunable ring of rows that have scrolled off the top of the
// TerminalScreen. Each row preserves both its cells (so ANSI colours survive)
// and its write time — the instant its content was written, carried from the
// screen's per-row stamp, NOT the moment it scrolled off — so the Backscroll
// window and bug report render per-line timestamps that stay in order with the
// still-on-screen rows instead of jumping at the boundary.
//
// Single-threaded by design: the emulator drives every Append from the UI
// dispatcher's Feed path. The ring is never read off the UI thread, so no lock
// is needed.
//
// Capacity is the maximum number of scrolled-off rows the user can see and
// export. Settable at runtime via SetCapacity — shrinking drops the oldest
// rows first, growing reserves space without touching live rows.
//
// Memory: at 80 columns and 24 bytes per Cell (rough upper bound), each 1000
// rows is ~1.9 MB, so the 4000-row default holds ~7.7 MB. Users who want a
// deeper history raise it via SetCapacity and pay the memory for it explicitly.
