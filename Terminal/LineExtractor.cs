// Completion paths (in order of how the screen typically finishes a line):
//   1. Scrolled off the top. The row left the live screen and landed in
//      ScrollbackBuffer. This is the BBS-typical case (a server-sent LF at the
//      bottom of the screen pushes the top row into history).
//   2. Cursor moved off the row via \n or an explicit cursor-position change.
//   3. Quiet-window timeout — any cell on the row gets overwritten after
//      >50 ms of no further writes to it (the "row went quiet, treat as
//      complete" rule).
//
// Threading: LineEmitted fires on whatever thread bumped the scrollback (the
// emulator's Feed path, already on the UI dispatcher in production).
// Subscribers that hand off to background work should Task.Run from their
// handler.
