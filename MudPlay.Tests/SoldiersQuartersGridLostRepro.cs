// Reproduction for the "LostWays Lockers" fragility (issue #478): looping the
// 4x5 grid of identically-named "Soldier's Quarters" (map 8, around 1703) in
// lostwaysrealm2 reliably drives RoomTracker to Lost.
//
// The grid (all 20 rooms share the name; only the exit-set distinguishes them,
// and even that collapses — the 6 interior rooms are all 4-way N/S/E/W):
//
//         col0   col1   col2   col3
//   row0: 1703 — 1702 — 1701 — 1699
//          |      |      |      |
//   row1: 1704 — 1708 — 1712 — 1716
//          |      |      |      |
//   row2: 1705 — 1709 — 1713 — 1717
//          |      |      |      |
//   row3: 1706 — 1710 — 1714 — 1718
//          |      |      |      |
//   row4: 1707 — 1711 — 1715 — 1719
//
// Root cause: a sent move only flips the tracker to Pending; position advances
// when a room display matches the predicted target (name + subset exits). There
// was no move<->display correlation token, so a stray re-display of the room the
// player is STILL in (a passing mob re-rendering the room, a look, a combat
// redraw) also matches the predicted target in a homogeneous grid, and the only
// guard was a 400ms timing floor that a normal-latency re-display slipped past —
// phantom-advancing the tracker one room ahead, invisibly (every room reads the
// same name) until the predicted exits stopped matching and it bailed to Lost.
//
// Fixed in two layers: NoteCommandDropped un-counts a move the rate limiter
// silently drops (the net miscount that made the drift permanent), and the echo
// gate advances position only once the server has echoed the move command back
// ("[HP=..]:s"), so a stray re-display without a preceding echo can no longer be
// mistaken for the landing — regardless of its timing. These tests drive the REAL
// grid through the REAL RoomTracker to prove both.
